Decorator.

Create a PersonOutputStream that implements the writePerson(Person) method and can decorate any given OutputStream.
Create a PersonOutputStream that implements the readPerson() method that returns a Person and can decorate any given InputStream.
The PersonOutputStream decorator must check if the name of the person starts with a capital letter and if it doesn't – it should update it before writing it to the destination.
The PersonInputStream decorator must check if the name of the person starts with a low letter and if it doesn’t – it should update it before writing it to the destination.
Write a program that uses the two decorators to write and read persons to and from a file



Abstract factory.

Person
Write a program that supports writing and reading from files and DB (Access DB using JDBC.ODBC) Writing to a file includes these features: Defining the file name to write or read from Wrapping with a buffer Writing/Reading Persons Writing to the DB is also done in three steps: Loading driver and creating connection Person to DB serializer which breaks Objects into Record and vise versa Writing/Reading Persons Client chooses to work with files or DB but once the choice was made – client code is identical in both cases. This means that and beside specifying the source (File/DB) working with the actual resource should be transparent and includes the following operations: void writePerson (Person) Person readPerson() Person readPerson (String name)
